# JungleClientApp
This is an application I made using the LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP). It also uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX, and BootStrap. This app is designed to be used as an in-house application for a Social Media Agency to use. Employees can log into the app and add and edit info for the clients they manage.
